# Excel Analysis Project

## Introduction

This is my second Excel-based data project, where I had the chance to apply more advanced tools and techniques than before. While my earlier work focused on the basics of data cleaning and visualization, this project allowed me to dive deeper into professional-level features within Excel.

## Excel Tools & Features Used

Throughout the analysis, I used a range of built-in and advanced Excel functionalities:

- Pivot Tables to summarize and group data efficiently

- Pivot Charts for dynamic and clear visualizations

- Power Query for data transformation and cleanup

- Power Pivot to build relationships between tables

- Basic DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures

## Project Goals & Analysis Scope

The purpose of this project is to explore the current state of the data job market and understand what makes certain roles more valuable than others. Using a dataset of real job listings from 2023, I set out to answer the following questions:

- Does having more technical skills lead to a higher salary?

- How do data job salaries vary by region?

- Which technical skills are most frequently required in the field?

- What are the average salaries associated with the top 10 in-demand skills?

By answering these questions, the goal is to identify patterns that can help job seekers — including myself — make informed decisions about skill development and career direction in the data industry.
